      <h2>About the Lab</h2>
      <p>
        WrightForge Lab is my experimental corner of the internet. I use it to explore how
        AI, automation, and data can improve real-world systems — especially contact centres,
        customer experience, and decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything here is work-in-progress. Some things will be polished; others will be scribbles,
        prototypes, or half-finished ideas. That’s the point.
      </p>
    
      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I’m Jason Wright, a contact centre operations and business support leader based in Southern Ontario.
        I work in regional government, where I lead a team focused on scheduling, training, quality assurance,
        analytics, and process improvement for a large call centre environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m particularly interested in how AI, automation, and better data can reduce friction for both customers
        and frontline staff—whether that’s through smarter workflows, more intuitive tools, or better use of the
        systems we already have. WrightForge Lab is my space to experiment, learn, and prototype ideas before they
        ever reach a production environment.
